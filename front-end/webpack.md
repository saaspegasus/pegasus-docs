Webpack-Specific Instructions
=============================

## Development with Webpack

Whenever you make modifications to the front-end files you will need to run
the following command to rebuild the compiled JS bundles and CSS files:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also set it up to watch for changes by running:

```bash
npm run dev-watch
```

or in Docker:

```
make npm-watch
```
