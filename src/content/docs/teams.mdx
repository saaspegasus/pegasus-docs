Teams are designed to provide sandboxes for groups of users collaborating on single project.
Users can join one or more teams, invite other users to their teams, and give different team members different roles.

Pegasus provides the building blocks to setup a team-based application.
Some of those building blocks are documented here.

**Note: all of the following examples assume you have setup Pegasus with teams enabled.**

## Example App

Pegasus ships with an optional built-in example application demonstrating the basics of working with team-based
models and views.

The example app includes:

1. A data model that belongs to a team.
2. A set of class based views for working with that data model, limited to the context of a team.


#### Third party examples

A Pegasus user Peter Cherna has created some more [example applications](https://github.com/pcherna/pegasus-example-apps/)
that demonstrate additional team-based examples, including functional views, pagination, APIs and working with "global" objects.

They are a great place to start for inspiration and getting something up and running quickly!

*Note: the example apps are not officially sanctioned/supported by Pegasus---though
features from them will be continually incorporated into future releases.*

## Data Models

Teams use three primary models - `apps.users.CustomUser`, `apps.teams.Team`, and `apps.teams.Membership`.

The `Membership` model uses [Django's "through" support](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through)
to extend the `User`/`Team` relationship with additional fields.

By default, a `role` field is added to represent the `User`'s role in the `Team` (admin or member).

### Team-based models

Data models that "belong" to a Team can subclass `BaseTeamModel`.

In addition to always including a `.team` field, this model also has an additional manager called
`for_team` that will automatically filter querysets based on the current team (set by the [context variable](#team-context-variable)).
This is useful to use to provide strict access to your data models (if they should never be accessed outside a team).

These two statements are approximately equivalent:

```python
MyTeamModel.for_team().filter(...)
MyTeamModel.objects.filter(team=get_current_team(), ...)
```

See the example app for additional usage examples.
For more strict logic around team queries, see [the strict team access section](#strict-team-access).

## Team Context variable

From version 2025.11, a [ContextVar](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html) is available to keep track of the current team.

The team is set automatically in views by the [middleware](#middleware) or by using the `current_team` context manager like this:

```python
a_team = Team.objects.get(slug='a-team')
with current_team(team):
    # get_current_team() will return the `a_team` object inside this block
    call_code_that_uses_the_curent_team()
    MyModel.for_team().all()  # only returns objects with `team=a_team`
```

## Team-based Views

At its core, all Team-based views need the following:

### Urls

See `apps.team.urls` for an example of how to set these up in your apps, and
your main `apps.{project}.urls` file for how to add them to your site's URLs.

Anything that goes into `team_urlpatterns` in `apps.{project}.urls` will automatically be added under the
URL `https://example.com/a/<team_slug>/`. The `team_slug` is a human-readable, URL-friendly version
of the team name that is auto-generated for you.

### Middleware

The `apps.teams.middleware.TeamsMiddleware` must be included in the list of middleware. It must be placed
after `django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`. The purpose of this middleware is to
set `request.team` and `request.team_membership` based on the current request. It will attempt to load
the team as follows:

* From the `team_slug` in the request path if available
* From the current session if available
* From the user's list of teams if available

If the `team_slug` is available from the request path but it does not match a team that the user has access to
then the request will terminate with a 404. Apart from this the middleware does not do any validation of the
team or the team membership. That is left to the decorators described below.

### Views

See `apps.team.views` for example team views.
All views that are referenced under `team_urlpatterns` must contain `team_slug` as the first argument.

In addition to adding this field, you will likely want to use one of the built-in permission
decorators (see below) to ensure the logged-in user can access the selected team.

Additionally, you will have to scope any data model access to the relevant Team
in any Database/ORM queries you make inside your views.

## Permission Control

Pegasus includes two convenience decorators for use in team views.
These can be found in `apps.teams.decorators`.

#### The `login_and_team_required` decorator

This decorator can be used to ensure that the logged in user has access to the team in the view.
It requires your view takes in a `team_slug`, as in the example views.
It can be used in functional views like this:

```python
@login_and_team_required
def a_team_view(request, team_slug):
    # other view logic here
    return render(request, 'web/my_template.html', context={
        'team': request.team,
    })
```

Or in class-based views like this:

```python
@method_decorator(login_and_team_required, name='dispatch')
class ATeamView(View):
    # other view details go here
```

If the current user does not have access to the team they will see a 404 page.
If no user is logged in they'll be redirected to a login view, just like the `login_required` decorator.

### The `team_admin_required` decorator

The `team_admin_required` decorator works just like the `login_and_team_required` decorator, except
in addition to checking team membership the role is also checked and if the user doesn't have
"admin" access they will not be able to access the view.

### The `LoginAndTeamRequiredMixin` and `TeamAdminRequiredMixin` classes

These mixins provide the same functionality as the decorators, but are designed to work with Django's generic
class-based views. They can be used like this:

```python
class ATeamModelListView(LoginAndTeamRequiredMixin, ListView):
    model = MyModel
```

See the example app for more details.

### Template tags

In addition to the decorators, you can also use template tags to check user / team access from a template.

This can be useful for hiding/showing certain content based on a user's team role.
The `is_member_of` filter can be used to check team membership, and the `is_admin_of` filter can be used
to check if _a_ user is a team admin. For example, the following will show only if the logged in user
is an admin of the associated team:

```jinja
{% load team_tags %}
{% if team and request.user|is_admin_of:team %}
  <p>You're an admin of {{team.name}}.</p>
{% elif team and request.user|is_member_of:team %}
  <p>You're a member of {{team.name}}.</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Sorry you don't have access to {{team.name}}.</p>
{% endif %}
```

### Adding Roles

The permission system is designed to be simple enough to easily use, but extensible enough that you can
customize it to match your project's needs.

Here's how you can add a new role to your app:

#### 1. Define the New Role in `roles.py`

First, you need to add your new role constant and update the choices in `apps/teams/roles.py`:

```python
ROLE_ADMIN = 'admin'
ROLE_MEMBER = 'member'
ROLE_MODERATOR = 'moderator'  # Add your new role here

ROLE_CHOICES = (
    # customize roles here
    (ROLE_ADMIN, 'Administrator'),
    (ROLE_MEMBER, 'Member'),
    (ROLE_MODERATOR, 'Moderator'),  # Add your new role choice here
)
```

Technically, this is all that's needed, as this will cause the role to show up in the invitation UI
and allow it to be used in team memberships.

However, you'll probably also want to use the role in your app permissions system.
To do that, you should also add a helper function for the new role if you want to use it in permission checks:

```python
def is_moderator(user: CustomUser, team) -> bool:
    if not team:
        return False

    from .models import Membership
    return Membership.objects.filter(team=team, user=user, role=ROLE_MODERATOR).exists()
```

#### 2. Update the Membership Model (if needed)

The `Membership` model in `models.py` already uses `roles.ROLE_CHOICES` for its role field,
so it will automatically pick up your new role.
However, you might want to add a helper method to the `Membership` model:

```python
class Membership(BaseModel):
    # ... existing code ...

    def is_moderator(self) -> bool:
        return self.role == roles.ROLE_MODERATOR
```

#### 3. Add a new decorator (if needed)

If you'd like to use the role in decorators, similar to `@team_admin_required` you can do so by adding
a new function to  `apps/teams/decorators.py`:

```
# import the and use function you created in step 1
from .roles import is_admin, is_member, is_moderator

def team_moderator_required(view_func):
    return _get_decorated_function(view_func, is_moderator)
```

#### 4. Use the role

You'll need to update any views or logic that handle role-based permissions,
by calling the helper functions and decorators you've defined above.

The specifics here will depend on the role you've added and the goals you're trying to achieve with it.

## Cookbooks

### Strict team access

If you want to ensure that your data models are only ever accessible in the context of a team, you can change the
declaration of the manager classes on `BaseTeamModel` as follows:

```python
class BaseTeamModel(BaseModel):
    """
    Abstract model for objects that are part of a team.
    """

    team = models.ForeignKey(Team, verbose_name=gettext("Team"), on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    # rename the global manager to `all_objects`. This will be used in the Django admin, but any calling code
    # using `.objects` will automatically filter by team.
    all_objects = models.Manager()

    # Override `.objects` with the TeamScopedManager to always filter
    objects = TeamScopedManager()


    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

You can also set `settings.STRICT_TEAM_CONTEXT = True` to fail hard if `.objects` is ever called without a valid team set.

If you do this, you never need to add `.filter(team=team)` to any of your queries, as the filter will be applied automatically.


### Partially using teams

Many projects might want to use teams in the background but hide them from users.
This can be useful in certain scenarios:

- If you know you want to use teams eventually, but haven't built out support for them yet.
- If your application has different user types, some of which belong to teams and some of which don't.

The recommended way to handle this situation is to **enable teams in Pegasus, but hide/restrict them in the UI**.
In this world, all users will still belong to a default team (which is created for them automatically),
and all models are associated with teams. However, the concept of teams will be hidden from users until you
decide to make them visible.

This allows you to easily "turn on" teams when you are ready, or migrate a user from a "non-team" to a "team" account,
while being able to use the same underlying business logic and not have to deal with complicated data migrations.

To achieve this, you should do something like the following:

1. Build your application with teams enabled.
   This will provide the data models and URL scaffolding to work with teams, and make using teams later much easier.
2. Hide the `team_name` field from the signup form (`signup.html`), and let teams be auto-created for new users.
3. Hide the team-related items from the application navigation (entry point is `app_nav.html`).
4. (Optional) Hide/remove out the team-based url mappings (entry point is `teams/urls.py`).
   Do this if you don't want people to be able to access team-related functionality
   even if they navigate to the right URL in the browser.
5. Continue building your application using the team-based models and URL patterns, but don't expose them to the user.


If you follow these steps it should be relatively easy to expose teams down the line instead of having to deal with
a complicated migration. That process will mostly involve un-hidng the team functionality that was hidden.

<Aside title="Supporting team and non-team users">
If you have different categories of users, some on teams and some not, then instead of hiding the functionality
mentioned above, you should instead conditionally enable it based on the type of user that is logged in.
