There are four CSS themes available in Pegasus.

**If you don't know which one you want, we recommend TailwindCSS.**
It is the most popular choice, easiest to customize, and supports themes and dark mode out-of-the-box.

In addition to Tailwind, there is a [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) theme, a [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) theme, and a
deprecated theme based on Creative Tim's [Material Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit)
and [Material Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard) products (not recommended).

The look and feel of the site is slightly different for each framework, but the overall layout is the same.
Below are screenshots of the app in each of the four themes.

*If you're not sure which framework you want to use, you can change the setting on your project and download multiple
copies of the codebase to try out different ones.*
