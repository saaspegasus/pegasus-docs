description: How to get early access to new SaaS Pegasus features and development releases.
---

If you'd like to try out new Pegasus features before they're officially released,
you can request access to the early-access / beta testing program.

## What's in Early Access

You can see the [Development Release Notes](/release-notes-dev/) for a preview of what's currently in development.

With early access you have the opportunity to:

- **Test new features** before they're officially released
- **Provide feedback** that shapes the final implementation
- **Get a head start** on upcoming changes

It is worth noting that early-access features are more likely to have bugs as they have
not gone through the same rigor of QA and testing as final release features.

## How to Request Access

To request early access, reach out through one of these channels:

- **Slack**: Message in the SaaS Pegasus Slack community
- **Email**: [cory@saaspegasus.com](mailto:cory@saaspegasus.com)
