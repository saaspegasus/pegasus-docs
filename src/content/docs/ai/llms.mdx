Pegasus comes with an optional Chat UI for interacting with LLMs.
This section covers how it works and the various supported options.

## Configuring LLM

You can configure the models you want to use by setting the `LLM_MODELS` and `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL`
values in your `settings.py`. For example:

```python
LLM_MODELS = {
    "gpt-3.5-turbo": {"api_key": env("OPENAI_API_KEY", default="")},
    "gpt-4o": {"api_key": env("OPENAI_API_KEY", default="")},
    "claude-3-opus-20240229": {"api_key": env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", default="")},
    "ollama_chat/llama3": {"api_base": env("OLLAMA_API_BASE", default="http://localhost:11434")},  # requires a running ollama instance
}
DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL = env("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL", default="gpt4o")
```

The chat UI will use whatever is set in `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL` out-of-the-box, but you can quickly change it
to another model to try different options.

For further reading, see the documentation of the [litellm Python API](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion),
and [litellm providers](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

## Running open source LLMs

To run models like Mixtral or Llama3, you will need to run an [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) server in a separate process.

<Steps>
1. [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and run Ollama or use the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama)
2. Download the model you want to run:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3
   # or with docker
   docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3
   ```
   See the [documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/ollama) for the list of supported models.
3. Update your django settings to point to the Ollama server. For example:
   ```python
   LLM_MODELS = {
       "ollama_chat/llama3": {"api_base": "http://localhost:11434"},
   }
   DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL = "ollama_chat/llama3"
   ```
4. Restart your Django server.
</Steps>

## The Chat UI

The Chat UI has multiple different implementations, and the one that is used for your project will be determined
 by your build configuration.

If you build with asynchronous functionality enabled *and* htmx then it will use a websocket-based Chat UI.
This Chat UI supports streaming responses for OpenAI models, and is the recommended option.
It is also currently the only option that supports the chat widget that can be embedded on any page.

If you build without asynchronous functionality enabled, the chat UI will instead use Celery and polling.
The React version of the chat UI also uses Celery and polling.
This means that [Celery must be running](/celery) to get responses from the LLM.

### The Chat widget

*The chat widget is currently only available if your project is using HTMX and Async.*

The chat widget is a small component that can be embedded on any page of your app.
By default, it is included in your `chat_home.html` file, so you can view a demo of the widget
from the "AI Chat" tab in your app.

#### Adding the chat widget to a page

To add the chat widget to a page, you can follow the example in `chat_home.html`.
There are two steps:

First, include the component at the end of the `<body>` tag.
If you're extending the `app_base.html` file this will be at the end of the `{% block app %}` block.

```jinja
{% block app %}
...
{% include "chat/components/chat_overlay.html" %}
{% endblock app %}
```

Then, add the `ws_initialize.js` in your page JavaScript:

```jinja
{% block page_js %}
<!-- If using vite -->
  {% vite_asset 'assets/javascript/chat/ws_initialize.ts' %}
<!-- If using webpack -->
  <script src="{% static 'js/chat-ws-initialize-bundle.js' %}" defer></script>
{% endblock page_js %}
```

If you want to add the chat widget to all pages in your app, you can add it to the `base.html` file.
For all logged-in pages, you can add it to the `app_base.html` file.

## Using Agents

As of version 2025.9.1, Pegasus includes a set of example agents that you can use as a foundation for building
your own agents. These agents are built with [Pydantic AI](https://docs.pydantic-ai.com/), and include:

- A weather and location lookup agent, with tools to do geo-lookups and access current weather information.
- A chatbot to interact with employee application data models, with tools to work with employee data.
- A chatbot to interact with system database, with MCP tool to access postgres data.
- A tool to send emails.

For more information on these agents and how they work, you can watch this video:

</div>


### Setting the agent model and keys

To change the agent model you can set the `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL` setting in your `settings.py` file or
environment variables / `.env` file.

For a list of available models, see the [Pydantic AI documentation](https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/overview/).

You will also need to set the API keys for the models you want to use in the environment,
 according to the Pydantic AI docs.

 For example, to use any OpenAI models you need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## Choosing an LLM model (deprecated)

Older versions of Pegasus allowed you to choose between two options for your LLM chat: OpenAI and LiteLLM.
As of version 2025.9.1, all projects will now use [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/),
which fully supports OpenAI, as well as Anthropic, Google, and local models.
This makes it easy to use different models depending on your specific application needs.

## Configuring OpenAI (deprecated)

If you're using OpenAI, you need to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or settings file (`.env` in development).
You can also change the model used by setting `OPENAI_MODEL`, which defaults to `"gpt-4o"`.

See [this page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) for help
finding your OpenAI API key.
