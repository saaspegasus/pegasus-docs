## Version 2026.2

This release focuses on improving AI-assisted development with a number direct and indirect improvements.

### Standalone Frontend ported to shadcn/ui

**The standalone React frontend has been completely redesigned using shadcn/ui components.**
Shadcn has become the de-facto recommended way to build a standalone React frontend and LLMs are
very good at working with it. This makes it a natural choice for the standalone frontend for Pegasus moving forwards.

Details:

- New sidebar component using shadcn's responsive sidebar pattern
- All form inputs, buttons, labels, and cards now use shadcn components
- Authentication pages (login, signup, password reset) redesigned with consistent styling
- Profile page and navigation demo updated to use shadcn components
- Added shadcn configuration file (`components.json`) for easy component management
- Added path alias `@/*` for cleaner imports

See the [updated Standalone React Front End documentation](/experimental/react-front-end/) for details.

### Type Checking with Mypy (Experimental)


One of the most important principles of successfully building complex applications with agents is that
you should give them as many tools as possible to help them verify their work.
Type checking is one of these tools that can help agents catch errors and bugs and verify their work.

To assist with this, **Pegasus now includes optional support for static type checking using mypy and django-stubs.**
When enabled, your project will include pre-configured mypy settings, and type checking runs automatically in GitHub Actions CI.

In addition, a large number of small changes were made to the codebase to add type hints and fix typing issues
so that mypy works out of the box on all tested build configurations.

Note: this features is labeled as experimental because not every combination of Pegasus features has
been fully tested by mypy, but it will become an official supported feature in the next release and is
safe to enable and use.

See the new [Type Checking documentation](/experimental/type-checking/) for details.


### Git Worktree Support (Experimental)

Another growing trend in AI programming is the use of git worktrees to enable parallel development on multiple branches simultaneously.
Worktrees allow you (or agents) to work on multiple branches at once without overwriting each branch's changes.

To assist with using worktrees, Pegasus adds some utilities that help you create and manage worktrees.
Specifically, you can now create isolated git worktrees with unique ports for all services,
enabling parallel development on multiple branches simultaneously, giving each worktree its own database
and web ports (so multiple worktrees can run in browsers concurrently).

Specifically, each worktree gets its own:
- Django port (starting at 8000, incrementing for each worktree)
- Vite dev server port (starting at 5173)
- PostgreSQL instance port (starting at 5432)
- Redis instance port (starting at 6379)

To create a worktree, use the new `/worktree` Claude Code skill or run:

```bash
./scripts/create-worktree.sh feature-name
```

This feature is experimental.
See the [Git Worktrees documentation](/experimental/git-worktrees/) for details.

### Pegasus Skills for Claude Code

[Pegasus Skills](https://github.com/saaspegasus/pegasus-skills) are specialized skill files
that enhance Claude Code's capabilities when working with Pegasus projects.
The first skill, `resolve-pegasus-conflicts`, helps resolve merge conflicts that arise during Pegasus upgrades.
You can invoke it with `/resolve-pegasus-conflicts` or by asking Claude Code for help with merge conflicts.

See the [AI Integrations documentation](/ai/development/#pegasus-skills-for-claude-code) for installation instructions and details.

### Other Changes

**Added**

- **Added support for superuser API permissions.** New `IsSuperUser`, `IsAuthenticatedSuperUser`,
  and `IsAuthenticatedOrHasUserAPIKeySuperUser` permission classes for restricting API endpoints to superusers only.
  - Also added tests.
- Added an error notification when HTMX requests fail.
- The `dev.sh` script (and `make dev`) now starts the standalone frontend dev server alongside Django and Vite.

**Changed**

- Django and Vite ports are now configurable via environment variables.
  Set `DJANGO_PORT`, `DJANGO_VITE_PORT`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, and `REDIS_PORT` in your `.env` file.
  Docker Compose should use these ports automatically. This helps enable the worktree workflow outlined above.
- Changed the default development docker setup to only expose postgres and redis ports over localhost.
  This improves security if you are doing development on a machine that's exposed to the public internet.
- Moved `django-browser-reload` and `django-watchfiles` to development requirements and only set them up if `DEBUG=True`.
  Thanks Saif for the suggestion!
- Switched from `psycopg2-binary` to `psycopg[binary]`, as recommended by the latest Django docs. Thanks Saif for the suggestion!
- API key display and revocation now uses key prefix instead of ID. Thanks Brennon for the suggestion!
- Added configurable Docker user/group in Dockerfile.
  You can now customize the user and group IDs via build args (`SITE_UID`, `SITE_GID`, `SITE_USER`, `SITE_GROUP`).
  Thanks Geoff for the suggestion!
- Added a longer default deploy timeout (180 seconds) for Kamal deployments.
  Thanks Aurelien for the suggestion!
- Changed assertion statements to proper exceptions in subscription views and employee views for better error handling.

**Fixed**

- Fixed shadcn/daisyUI CSS variable mappings. Accent colors are no longer overridden by shadcn by default,
  which was causing inconsistent styling on DaisyUI accent components.
- Vite now ignores large directories (`.venv`, `node_modules`, `.git`) when watching files.
  This helps prevent exhausting system inotify watchers. Thanks Jacob for the suggestion!
- Switched some model references to use `gettext_lazy` instead of `gettext` for translatable strings,
  which is the correct pattern for model-level translations. Thanks Saif for reporting!
- Fixed tests failing when using manifest storage by adding a test base class that overrides storage settings.
  Thanks Brennon for reporting!
- **Made many minor code-quality improvements caught by the type checker:**
  - Subscription signals now handle missing subscriptions more gracefully/explicitly.
  - Added proper return types and null checks in subscription helpers
  - Fixed type hints in AI agents and tools
  - Added type annotations to settings and model files
  - Fixed import paths for `Message` class in teams tests
  - Added type ignores with explanatory comments where necessary
