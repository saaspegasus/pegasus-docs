## Version 2026.1

This release adds experimental git worktree support for parallel development, ports the standalone React frontend to shadcn/ui, switches from `psycopg2-binary` to `psycopg[binary]`, and includes numerous type fixes and improvements.

### Git Worktree Support (Experimental)

You can now create isolated git worktrees with unique ports for all services, enabling parallel development on multiple branches simultaneously. Each worktree gets its own:
- Django port (starting at 8000, incrementing for each worktree)
- Vite dev server port (starting at 5173)
- PostgreSQL instance port (starting at 5432)
- Redis instance port (starting at 6379)

To create a worktree, use the new `/worktree` Claude Code skill or run:
```bash
./scripts/create-worktree.sh feature-name
```

See the [Git Worktrees documentation](/experimental/git-worktrees/) for details.

### Standalone Frontend ported to shadcn/ui

**The standalone React frontend has been completely redesigned using shadcn/ui components.** This includes:
- New sidebar component using shadcn's responsive sidebar pattern
- All form inputs, buttons, labels, and cards now use shadcn components
- Authentication pages (login, signup, password reset) redesigned with consistent styling
- Profile page and navigation demo updated to use shadcn components
- Added shadcn configuration file (`components.json`) for easy component management
- Added path alias `@/*` for cleaner imports

### Other Changes

**Added**

- **Added support for superuser API permissions.** New `IsSuperUser`, `IsAuthenticatedSuperUser`, and `IsAuthenticatedOrHasUserAPIKeySuperUser` permission classes for restricting API endpoints to superusers only. Includes comprehensive tests.
- **Added an error notification when HTMX requests fail.** The app base template now shows a dismissible error banner on HTMX errors.
- **Added experimental mypy type checking to GitHub Actions CI** for builds that have type checking enabled.
- **Added type checker guidelines to generated project AI rules** when mypy is enabled, including patterns for Django lazy translation strings.
- **Added configurable Docker user/group in Dockerfile.** You can now customize the user and group IDs via build args (`SITE_UID`, `SITE_GID`, `SITE_USER`, `SITE_GROUP`). Thanks Geoff for the contribution!
- **Added a longer default deploy timeout (180 seconds) for Kamal deployments.** Thanks Aurelien for the suggestion!

**Changed**

- **Switched from `psycopg2-binary` to `psycopg[binary]`.** This is the modern PostgreSQL adapter recommended by the psycopg team. Thanks Saif for the suggestion!
- **API key revocation now uses key prefix instead of ID.** This is more secure as it doesn't expose internal database IDs. Thanks Brennon for the contribution!
- **Django and Vite ports are now configurable via environment variables.** Set `DJANGO_PORT`, `DJANGO_VITE_PORT`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, and `REDIS_PORT` in your `.env` file. Docker Compose will use these ports automatically.
- **Vite now ignores large directories (`.venv`, `node_modules`, `.git`) when watching files.** This prevents exhausting system inotify watchers when running multiple Vite instances in parallel. Thanks Jacob for the contribution!
- **Teams model now uses `gettext_lazy` instead of `gettext`** for translatable strings, which is the correct pattern for model-level translations. Thanks Saif for reporting!
- **Fixed shadcn/daisyUI CSS variable mappings.** The muted and radius variables now use the correct daisyUI equivalents, and accent colors are no longer overridden by default.

**Fixed**

- **Fixed tests failing when using manifest storage** by adding a test base class that overrides storage settings. Thanks Brennon for reporting!
- **Fixed `.env` sourcing in `dev.sh` to support special characters** in environment variable values.
- **Fixed subscription signals to handle missing subscriptions gracefully** instead of raising attribute errors.
- **Fixed various type annotations throughout the codebase** to pass stricter type checking, including:
  - Added proper return types and null checks in subscription helpers
  - Fixed type hints in AI agents and tools
  - Added type annotations to settings and model files
  - Fixed import paths for `Message` class in teams tests
  - Added type ignores with explanatory comments where necessary
- **Fixed assertion statements converted to proper exceptions** in subscription views and employee views for better error handling.
- **Fixed standalone frontend dev server not being managed by `dev.sh`** - it's now started and stopped alongside Django and Vite.
