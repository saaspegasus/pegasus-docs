## Version 2026.2.1

This release removes `litellm` and unifies all AI calls through Pydantic AI.
It also includes a number of smaller features and fixes.

### AI app migration and cleanup


- **All AI calls now go through [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) instead of using a mix of LiteLLM and Pydantic AI**:
  - Removed the `litellm` dependency. All chat and agent interactions now use Pydantic AI exclusively.
  - Replaced `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL` and `DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL` settings with a single `DEFAULT_AI_MODEL` setting.
  - The `LLM_MODELS` dictionary has also been removed in favor of Pydantic AI's built-in model configuration.
  - API keys are now read directly from standard environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.)
    instead of being configured per-model.
  - Removed the `chat/utils.py` module (`get_llm_kwargs` and `UnknownModelError`) which is no longer needed.
- **Simplified the chat system, by removing the distinction between "chat" and "agent" session types**:
  - Removed the `Chat.chat_type` field. Chats are now identified solely by their `Chat.agent_type`
    field (e.g. `chat`, `weather`, `admin`, `employees`).
    Added migration to populate the `agent_type` field for existing chats.
  - Merged `ChatSession` and `AgentSession` into a single `ChatSession` class.
  - Consolidated WebSocket routing. Instead of separate WebSocket endpoints per agent type (e.g. `/ws/weatheragent/`, `/ws/adminagent/`),
    all chats now use the existing `/ws/aichat/` endpoint with an `agent_type` query parameter.
  - Removed per-agent consumer classes in favor of a unified `ChatConsumer`.
- Fixed a few bug in certain cases where chats did not always resume with the correct agent or history
  when loaded from the chat history page.

See the upgrading section below for migration details.

### Other Changes

- **Upgraded all JavaScript packages** including Flowbite to 4.x.
  - Added minimal theme variables needed for Flowbite 4.x dashboard compatibility.
- **Upgraded all Python packages**, with `dj-stripe` still pinned to 2.9.1 to avoid compatibility issues with newer versions.
- **Added Claude Code skills for upgrading JavaScript and Python dependencies** to generated projects.
  These have also been added to the [django-skills](https://github.com/saaspegasus/django-skills) repository.
- Migrated the test 400, 403, 404, and 500 error pages to Django's built in views for more realistic error simulations.
  Thanks Brennon for suggesting!

## Other Fixes

- Added `types-requests` as an explicit mypy dev dependency.
- Fixed the MCP agent tool to use `psycopg2-binary` instead of `psycopg[binary]` for the database connection.

### Upgrading

To migrate to the latest AI code changes, you will need to update your environment variables:

- Replace `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL` and `DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL` with `DEFAULT_AI_MODEL`.
  The new format is `provider:model_name` (e.g. `openai:gpt-4o`). See the [Pydantic AI model docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/overview/) for available models.
- Also make sure your API keys are defined in your enviornment variables, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.
