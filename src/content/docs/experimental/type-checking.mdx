title: Type Checking with Mypy
description: Enable static type checking in your Pegasus project using mypy and django-stubs.

import ExperimentalFeature from '../../../components/ExperimentalFeature.astro';

<ExperimentalFeature />

Pegasus includes optional support for static type checking using [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/)
and [django-stubs](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs).
When enabled, type checking runs automatically in GitHub Actions CI.

*This feature is currently marked as experimental because not every combination of Pegasus features has
been fully tested by mypy. However, most common configurations are tested and should work out of the box.
However, enabling type checking is perfectly safe.*

## Enabling Type Checking

Type checking can be enabled from your project's configuration page
under "Developer Setup" -> "Advanced".
When enabled, your project will include:

- `mypy`, `django-stubs`, and other stub libraries as development dependencies
- A mypy configuration in your `pyproject.toml`
- Type checking in the GitHub Actions CI workflow
- Additional guidelines in AI skills files for working with types


## Running Type Checks

To run type checking locally:

```bash
# With uv
uv run mypy .

# Without uv
mypy .
```

## Configuration

Type checking is configured in your `pyproject.toml` file.
The default configuration should pass out of the box for all new Pegasus projects.

*If you run into any mypy errors with your project's configuration on a new project,
please report them [via email or Slack](https://www.saaspegasus.com/support/).*

## Documentation (and AI Skills)

Your project's AI skills files will now include additional guidelines for working with types.
If you're using Claude Code, you can run

```
/fix-types
```

as a skill in Claude Code to run interactive type check fixes on your code.

The skills file is also open source and [documented here](https://github.com/saaspegasus/django-skills/blob/main/skills/fix-types/SKILL.md)
if you'd like to see details on suggested fixes and resolution patterms.
Please contribute if you have any suggestions for improvements!

## Upgrading / adding type checking

When you first enable type checking for your project you will likely get some errors in your own code.
The easiest way to resolve these is via the `/fix-types` skill mentioned above.
