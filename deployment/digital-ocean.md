## Digital Ocean

Pegasus provides native support for Digital Ocean App Platform.
To build for Digital Ocean, choose the "digital_ocean_app_platform" option when installing Pegasus.
Then follow the steps below to deploy your app.

### Prerequisites

If you haven't already, create your Digital Ocean account.
**You can sign up with [this link](https://m.do.co/c/432e3abb37f3) to get $100 credit
and help support Pegasus.**

Next, install and configure the `doctl` command line tool by following [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/apis-clis/doctl/how-to/install/).

Additionally, you must connect Digital Ocean to your project's Github repository.
This can be done from inside App Platform, or by following [this link](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/github/install).

### Deploying

Once you've configured the prerequisites, deploying is just a few steps.

If you are planning to use Celery or Redis (Valkey), first create your Database cluster.
The easiest way to do this is in Digital Ocean Dashboard.

Navigate to [Databases --> New](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases/new), and choose
"Valkey".

It's recommended to name this database `<your-project>-redis`.

Next edit the `/deploy/app-spec.yaml` file. In particular, make sure to set your Github repository and branch.
If you aren't using Celery, you can remove the sections related to redis, and the celery-worker.
If you are using Redis/Valkey, the cluster name must match what you chose when you created the Database.

Finally, run `doctl apps create --spec deploy/app-spec.yaml`

That's it!
In a few minutes your app should be online.
You can [find and view it here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps).

**After deploying, review the [production checklist](/deployment/production-checklist.md) for a list
of common next steps**

### Settings and Secrets

App platform builds use the `settings_production.py` file.
You can add settings here, and use environment variables to manage any secrets, following the pattern used
throughout the file.

Environment variables can be managed in the Digital Ocean dashboard [as described here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/use-environment-variables/).

### Running One-Off Commands

The easiest way to run once-off commands in your app is to click the "console" tab in app platform and just type in the command.
See the screenshot below for what it looks like:

You may also need to run additional commands to get up and running, e.g. `./manage.py bootstrap_subscriptions`
for initializing your Stripe plan data.

### Celery Support

Celery should work out-of-the box.

If you have issues running celery, ensure that you have created a Redis database, and that the values for the
`REDIS_URL` environment variables match the name you've chosen.

If you need to run `celerybeat` (for scheduled/periodic tasks), you'll have to add a second worker to your
`app-spec.yaml` file. You can copy and paste the configuration for the `celery` worker, but replace
the `run_command` with the following line (swapping in your app name for `your_app`):

```
celery -A your_app beat -l INFO
```

Note that simply adding `--beat` or `-B` to the existing Celery worker does *not* work on app platform.
